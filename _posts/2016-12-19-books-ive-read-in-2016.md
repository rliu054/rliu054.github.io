## The effective engineer

Fantastic book. I've been following Edmond's [blog](http://www.theeffectiveengineer.com/blog) and was often amazed by his unique insights. To achieve a successful career, you must relentlessly find leverage to make a bigger impact. Whether it be automate as much as you can, focus on high leverage activities, optimize for learning, minimize your burden.

## The Go Programming Language
Good introduction book on Go. I've been watching Go for quite some time and built several side projects. It's great for server-side development, it's a compiled language with great speed, I particularly like gofmt tool and I use it to format my code on every save.

It's also an opinionated in many ways, the OO concept in Go is different than most popular OO languages. The native concurrency support and channels are what really make it shine.

I'm going to build more projects with Go to explore its full power.

## Web Scalability for Startup Engineers
A fantastic book on scalability, it touches all aspects of the stack and give your an overview of what are the pinpoints and challenges. Very solid advice.

Though the best advice I get is: your startup probably won't grow to this scale so don't worry about this and just use AWS :). I think it's absolutely true for 90% of startups. Of course it's great you build software with scalability in mind from the very beginning, however it could drain lots of your engineering efforts if you're still trying to make a profit for your business. AWS makes a lot of sense in this case, only when you've grown beyond a certain threshold should you worry about building your own solution.

## Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning
I decided to pick up this book because Edmond mentioned a few times in his blog, so I figured why not read it in its entirety? Turns out to be a good investment of my time.

We read a lot ideas every day, but very few of those **sticks** to our brain, there're scientific evident that techniques like active retrieval can drastically boost your learning outcomes.
