## Hardware
* Work space
  * For me, a quiet working means 30% productivity boost.

  * Two 27 inch screens (I had good experience with Samsung monitors).

  * Bose QC Noice cancelling headphones, go for the wireless ones if you can afford it.

  * Ergonomic (+mechanical) keyboard (your wrist will salute you).
* Desk & Chair
  * Standing desk.
  * Foot paddle (under the desk).
  * Comfortable chair with good back support.
* Light
  * Soft table lighting (better if you have proper natural light).
